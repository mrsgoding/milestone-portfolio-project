              <h3>Rogue Pickings Website</h3>
              <p>This project’s goal was two-fold: 1) code a site for a client
                who works in the food truck industry and 2) expand the site by
                creating an “About” page. I began again by extracting images and
                gathering measurements using Photoshop. Then, I coded the site
                using HTML and CSS. The biggest challenge was designing and
                linking the “About” page, but through grit and hard work, the
                task was accomplished.</p>

              <h3>Jubilee Austen Project</h3>
              <p>The primary objective for this project was to recreate this
                one-page portfolio site using a pre-made design comp. I began by
                 extracting images from Photoshop and then coding the HTML
                 structure and content. I finally styled the site to perfection
                 using CSS. The biggest challenge was figuring out the box-model
                 measurements so that the site exactly resembled the design
                 comp. Mastering my browser’s developer tools helped me achieve
                 the desired result.</p>

              <h3>Holstee Manifesto</h3>
              <p>The goal of this project was to code a Holstee Manifesto in a
                new and vibrant way. I began by structuring the HTML and then
                made it look pretty with CSS. A challenge I overcame was
                learning how to float items in CSS. I also learned how to use
                the box-model first hand to align each box correctly.</p>

            <h3>I will take your website from the bottom to the very top.</h3>
            <p>It is my goal to see each client's project through to the very end. I
              believe in beauty, imagination, hard work, and the power of
              relationship to transform projects - and to transform lives.
              </p>
            <p>Even though I was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago,
              I ironically love to climb mountains, both literally and
              figuratively. By far, my favorite summit has been the Chimney Tops
              in the Great Smokey Mountains. My goal is to one day climb Mt.
              Kilimanjaro!</p>
            <p>I am dedicated to building websites with the same passion,
              perseverance, and drive to see beauty that it takes to climb a
              mountain - one step at a time.</p>
